A notepad to serve as a place to record future ideas and features I want to implement.

BEFORE LAUNCH:
change to gunicorn


In progress:
- Debug timer not working
- Check redis/socket logic



Scrapped:
- Create session on frontend
- online Toggle
    - make create and join session not available
    - make timer work when offline
    - check online mode on before emitting
    - replace YOUR_SESSION_ID with currentSessionID



Future ideas:
- Leave session button/functionality
- Join session text field
- View users in room/create name when joining room
- Music sync (youtube based?)
